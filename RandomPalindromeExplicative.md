Random Palindrome

/*
Random Palindrome: Write a function that takes integer N as a parameter. This function then generates N random digits (numbers between 0 and 9) using the computer time as the seed of the random number generator.
The probability that a generated digit is even is 80% whereas the probability that a generated digit is odd is 20%.
The function the concatenates the N randomly created digits to form one number. This function then checks if this number is a palindrome or not. (Hint: find the reverse of that number)
Finally, the function prints out the number and says whether it is a palindrome or not.

Example 1:
Please enter the length of a number: 6
The concatenation of the 6 randomly generated numbers is: 258852
The number is a palindrome!

Example 2:
Please enter the length of a number: 5
The concatenation of the 5 randomly generated numbers is: 86824
The number is NOT a palindrome!

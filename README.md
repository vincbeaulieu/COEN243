# COEN243
Random Palindrome

This is one of my Assignment problem that was due on 13 March, 2018 for my COEN243 class.
I coded this has an example of how to code and solve this kind of problem,
not to copy-paste in any due work, assignment...
I'm not responsable of any plagiarisme.
This code is not perfect, if ther is error or bug, feel free to notice me.

Below, you'll find the question.

/*
Random Palindrome: Write a function that takes integer N as a parameter. This function then generates N random digits (numbers between 0 and 9) using the computer time as the seed of the random number generator.
The probability that a generated digit is even is 80% whereas the probability that a generated digit is odd is 20%.
The function the concatenates the N randomly created digits to form one number. This function then checks if this number is a palindrome or not. (Hint: find the reverse of that number)
Finally, the function prints out the number and says whether it is a palindrome or not.

Example 1:
Please enter the length of a number: 6
The concatenation of the 6 randomly generated numbers is: 258852
The number is a palindrome!

Example 2:
Please enter the length of a number: 5
The concatenation of the 5 randomly generated numbers is: 86824
The number is NOT a palindrome!

Hope it helped you understanding this kind of problem.
